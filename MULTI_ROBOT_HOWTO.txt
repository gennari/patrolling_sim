       How to run the MRP agents on different robots
==========================================================

1. Prepare your robots so that they can navigate in the environment 
with move_base. Configure the network so that they can communicate
each other.

*** TODO: check topic and frame names ***


2. Copy the 'patrolling_sim' and 'tcp_interface' packages
on all the robots.


3. Configure the file tcp_interface/config/UDPpeers.cfg adding
one line for each host IP in the team. 
Leave the port numbers as 9100 9110 in all the lines.

Example:

192.168.56.1	9100	9110
192.168.56.101	9100	9110
192.168.56.102	9100	9110

You can use the same file with all the IPs in all the machines.

4. Modify the launch file robot_template.launch in patrolling_sim/launch
for use your own robot. The file have to run all the robot node for use move_base
and amcl. The launchfile have to use an arg named robotname for the namespace.
Patrolling node sends necessary commands to robots through /robot_name/move_base action server, 
read the robot pose from the topic /robot_name/amcl_pose and provides the map with the 
map_server on the topic /map.

5. Start the script 'start_experiment_distributed.py' on all
the robots.


6. On each robot, select the map, the number of robots, the algorithm
and other info in the launcher. Choose the proper network tcp_interface
(e.g. wlan0) corresponding to the robot network.
The only differences among the different robots should be these ones:
* From-To: each robot has a unique identifier
* Monitor: true only on one robot.

*Note*: the monitor program is a centralized node that is used only to collect information about the robots and to compute the performance. It does not send any information to the robots (except for the start signal at the beginning), thus it is not a centralized component of the system.
